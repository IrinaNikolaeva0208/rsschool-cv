About myself:
I'm the second-year student of the BSU (Faculty of radiophysics and computer technologies). To be honest, I hated programming at school, but after entering the university I understood that it can be very interesting. If to speak about my traits of character, I can say that I am responsible, responsive, honest and friendly :)
